"""
Here, the idea was to find k non-adjacent houses. This was the hint to binary search. Since we can have any houses chosen, even in between and not necessarily two houses robbed
have 1 house between them! This is very important hint that it may either be DP or binary search.

The dynamic programming solution involves a state dp[houseIndex][numberOfHousesRobbed]. Since we iterate over n houses and track up to k robbed houses, 
the problem becomes more complex, and solving it with dynamic programming takes O(nâ‹…k) time.

We use binary search to find a value mid_reward such that this value has at least k houses non adjacent smaller than it and then we keep making mid_reward smaller
if we have found a solution by making max_reward = mid_reward (store the mid_reward as it is one answer to store)

and we keep making the values smaller as we find results storing max_reward = mid_reward to store potential answer.

If smaller than k potential_thefts then we do min_reward = mid_reward+=1 which takes the upper bound now or gets completed as min_reward = max_reward
